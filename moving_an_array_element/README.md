# Move Element in Array

This repository contains a solution to the problem of moving an element in an array to a new position based on a specified index and offset.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to write a function that takes an array, an index of an element, and an offset value. The function should move the element from the specified index to a new position determined by the offset, without modifying the original array. If the offset would result in an invalid position (either out of bounds or negative), the function should return an error message and return the original array.
