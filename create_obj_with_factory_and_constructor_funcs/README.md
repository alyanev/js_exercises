### This exercise demonstrates how to create objects in JavaScript using two different methods: Factory Function and Constructor Function.

### Factory Function:

A factory function is a function that returns an object. It does not use the this keyword and instead returns an object directly.

### Constructor Function:

A constructor function uses the this keyword to define properties for the newly created object. The function is typically invoked with the new keyword to create instances of the object.
